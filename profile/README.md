# WeAre


# WeAim

We are a group of sophomore CSE students from VIT Chennai, passionate about collaborating and helping juniors from VIT and other engineering colleges. Our mission is to solve problems together, build projects, and share knowledge.

Having faced many challenges in our first year, we’ve gained enough experience to guide you through similar situations. You can ask us why something isn’t working, or the questions AI tools like GPT couldn’t fully answer. While AI can give quick answers, it doesn’t always understand your full plan — and that’s where we step in.

No question is too small or “silly” to ask — we’re here to help you learn without hesitation.

Our current domains of interest include:

-Web Development & Full Stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express)

-Programming (Python, Java, C, C++)

-Embedded Systems & Arduino

-Linux & ASM Programming

-Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

-Project Documentation

-IT Product Reviews & Critiques

-Verilog, ModelSim, LTspice

-GitHub & VS Code

-Suggestions for YouTube videos, playlists, and learning resources (in VIT)

-Hardware & software for embedded systems

-Doubts about VIT in general, syllabus, coding platforms - VPropel, VITcolab 


# ContactUs
To ask for help or discuss with us you can do the either - 
1) Go to discussions section of our communtity -> in the AskUs discussion post your questions.
2) Go to any of our public repository -> Go to issues section -> post your questions as an issue.
Note -  We will answer you / create a new repository for you and add you as an outside collaborator / create a public discussion for you -  based on the question you ask.
For extensive collaboration, it would be better to also provide link for the repository you have your project on.

# JoinUs
If you share our passion for learning, teaching, and building, we’d love to have you in our community.
Our mission is to help others through open-source programming — a space where knowledge flows freely and everyone grows together.

Why not start by lending a hand to juniors who might face the same challenges you once did?
Your experience could be the key that unlocks their success.

# InTheFuture
In the future we aim to create and sell innovative products, both software and hardware. After deploying AI-made apps, many individuals and companies face challenges in scaling or improving their solutions due to a lack of coding expertise. One of our goal is to become the bridge that maintains and enhances codebases, strengthens backend systems, and improves security — areas where AI still falls short.
